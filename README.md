### Thougth on AI
I am not the biggest enthusiast of generative AI, but as a technology it is clear that it change our lives and **must evolve**.

The way is to use AI, but we must not forget or ignore the evidences that **AI is destructive** for humanity.

*I only prompt things that I am capable of doing*
